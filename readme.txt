This plugin allows you to add testimonials to your site with a submission form and admin panel.  It also displays the testimonials via a widget.

== Description ==

With this plugin you have the ability to display a number of testimonials either in a page or post or as a widget on your sidebar.  The amount displayed is determined by you.  We also created a submission form that you can include in a post or page in order to have people submit their testimonials to you.  User submitted testimonials are added to a queue in your Wordpress Admin for your approval.

== Installation ==

   1. Install the plugin either via FTP or Admin backend
   2. Activate the plugin
   3. Go to the Random Testimonials Admin, under Settings
   4. Add any testimonials you already have (yes, you could even make some up)
   5. To have the testimonials show in a post use the following code: [show_testimonials limit="x"] and replace ‘x’ with the number of testimonials you would like displayed.
   6. To have the testimonials submission form displayed in a post/page use the following code: [testimonial_form]
   7. TO have the testimonials show in your sidebar, simply add the widget and save.
